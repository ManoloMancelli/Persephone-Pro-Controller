Version 1.2 is more or less the same as version 1.0

This time I will be using a custom designed carrier board that will eliminate a need for most of the tiny wires.

## 20.01.2026

- Designed Arduino Uno Mini footprint for PCB Design


- Designed initial layout for the carrier board



## TODO
- Check if gyroscope can be eliminated (Hardware)
- Check if gyroscope can be eliminated (Software)
- Design more ergonomic plastic parts
- Design carrier board
